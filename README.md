Project Name: How to bury a body

Project Description: We wanted to tackle the How To option with an idea that we thought would be unique while also going for a somewhat comedic twist on it. So we came up with the idea of How to bury a body. It was an idea that gave us the opportunity to use different props and backgrounds. We simply wanted to teach our fellow classmates how to bury a body while having a laugh.

Process: We divided the work among us with Vir being the person in charge of the camera and Mohid being the character and supporting any other camera or shots related work. Tengis edited the final cuts while Zion made the website. We started by grabbing the equipment and props and having Vir and Mohid’s friend play the role of the victim. We started our shooting inside one of the residential buildings. We talked to the security guard and he was willing to help us out with our project. We shot our scenes with him and in different rooms while also shooting CCTV footage. We then moved to an outside area for the final scene of burying a body and concluded our shooting there. We went and reviewed all our shots and named which shot was what and which shot would be considered the final shot to be used and then sent them over to Tenghis.

Tengis edited the clips, adding sound, effects, and whatever was necessary. Initially, Tengis cleaned the individual scenes by cutting the start and the ending parts of the videos, then ordered them in 3 parts so that it is easier to focus on individual parts. After that, focusing on fluid transition between scenes that is in line with the basic theme of the video was crucial. Furthermore, adding aftereffects, and on-display texts to enrichen the video was also a priority. 
 In the meantime, Zion worked on building the website. The website has a simple interface, with each step being represented as a "panel". Once each step was completed and the user was ready to proceed to the next step, the panel would fade out to reveal the next step, and so on. For scripting, we used Pure JS and Jquery to add the animation effects. 

Reflection: Judging by the reactions during class, it was safe to say that everyone enjoyed this project we put together. We managed to reach our goal of making everyone laugh while educating them the techniques that should be used when burning a body. We do think we could’ve done better in terms of the audio side by getting rid of the static noise and also balancing music and dialogue volumes in post production so that the actors are more audible during the scenes.
